feat(normalization): Enhance normalization and fix display errors

This commit introduces several improvements to the document normalization and display logic.

- **Enhanced Document Type Normalization**:
  - The `documents:normalize-columns` command now has a `--force` option to re-normalize all documents, even those that already have a document type.
  - The document type inference logic has been improved to first attempt extraction from the `source_url` before falling back to the document title and number. This provides more accurate document type classification for documents with a source URL.
  - The normalization logic now correctly handles different casings and abbreviations for "Undang-Undang".

- **Fixed Array to String Conversion Error**:
  - A new `getMetadataForDisplay()` method has been added to the `LegalDocument` model to handle nested arrays in the `metadata` field.
  - The `documents/show.blade.php` view has been updated to use this new method, which prevents the "Array to string conversion" error when displaying documents with complex metadata (e.g., those with `tik_summary`).

- **Autoloaded Metadata Helper**:
  - The `app/Helpers/MetadataDisplayHelper.php` is now autoloaded via `composer.json` to make it available globally.
